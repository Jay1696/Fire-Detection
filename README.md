Fire Detection in Images
Description about the dataset:

Data was gathered to train a model to differentiate between photographs of fire and other types of imagery (non-fire images). Data is separated into 2 files, one of which, called non-fireimages, has 244 images of nature and the other, called fireimages, contains 755 photographs of outdoor fires, some of which involve significant smoke (eg: forest, tree, grass, river, people, foggy forest, lake, animal, road, and waterfall).

Objective: To create a classification model that can detect fire in images

Models used: Sequential CNN from scratch, Pretrained Xception with modifications
